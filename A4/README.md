## Visualizations 

This visualization shows the time series graph of the rolling average of the number of confirmed covid cases per day over a 7 day window within the dates of February 1st, 2020 to October 15th, 2021 in Harris County, Texas. The x-axis represents the date within the aforementioned range and the y-axis represents the average number of confirmed cases (over 7 days). In order to interpret the graph, every point on the line corresponding to a date is the 7 day average of confirmed cases around that date. The rolling window average was chosen in this representation in order to remove the seasonality attributes involved in daily confirmed cases data. This representation allows us to clearly see the trends in reporting of confirmed covid cases over this time frame without noise introduced due to weekly reporting practices.  

The data used consists of the number of confirmed cases recorded per day over a given range of dates for Harris County, Texas. This is mostly around the Greater Houston Area. I chose to interpret the rate of infection as the number of confirmed cases per day. The formal definition of infection rate  is tricky to evaluate without having a good metric to obtain the population of at risk individuals. I believe for the sake of this analysis, the number of confirmed cases per day is a good metric to understand the infection rate.   

The yellow shaded region indicates when the mask mandate was in effect in Harris County. The gray area indicates when there was no data available regarding the mask mandate. In this county the mask mandate was introduced only in one time period as shown in the visualization. It is difficult to point out any direct significant relation between the mask mandates and the change in covid cases just by looking at this graph. We would need multiple experiments where we have more data at varying time frames or some sort of A/B experimenting to see how effective masks were in changing the rate of rise in covid cases per day. From the graph here, during the time after the mask mandate was lifted there seems to be a net average decline in the average number of covid cases per 7-day window. This could be due to a number of factors including vaccination rates, lockdown restrictions, travel restrictions and so on. There are too many other important factors here to speak towards any immediate significant conclusions using this data alone. Any direct correlations made on mask mandates with the change in infection rates from this visualization will need to be treated with a grain of salt.  

The smaller sized graph below is an auxiliary visualization showing the change in infection rates, i.e. the change in number of confirmed covid cases per day. This graph can be read in a similar manner to the one above it. The y-axis in this case is the change in the number of covid cases reported with respect to the previous date. The smaller graph shows large fluctuations during the time of mask mandates and reduced amplitude of these confirmed case reportings during the time after the mandate was lifted. This can be interpreted as the derivative function that describes the change in infection rates.  

 
## Reflection on Collaboration
The collaborative activities seemed very helpful in providing a lot of insight into different perspectives. However, due to the varying datasets handled by each of us it also became a bit overwhelming to parse through the information relevant to each of our specific cases. The kind of data largely governs the conclusions that can be drawn. The research question was, How did masking policies change the progression of confirmed COVID-19 cases from February 1, 2020 through October 15, 2021?   

The resource that helped me the most was the Slack group discussion. There were many useful discussions that were held here. A common conclusion that I observed in these discussions which resonated with my initial thinking regarding the data was that for some counties we did not have enough data to fully and completely answer the research question at hand. Although for others, there could be enough data available to maybe consider modelling it as discussed by Kevin Sweet and Grant Savage. Even so they seemed skeptical about how to interpret the results of such a model talking about SIR and GLM models.   

Regarding code, I utilized Grant Savage’s quick way of finding the rolling average which is shown below:
	
`df.column.rolling(window=7).mean().round()`

This proved very useful for calculating the rolling mean over the 7-day window in order to reduce seasonality from the time series data and observe the trends better. Andrew Zhou helped me interpret the understanding of the derivative function which made more sense to me after his explanation. The derivative function explaining changing slope of infection rates can be easily described as the day-to-day change in number of confirmed cases reported. This confirmed my stance on defining infection rates.  

I was also intrigued by the case of no mask mandate data and discussed some of these counties with Sandeep Tiwari. He worked with a county from Oklahoma that had no mask mandate data, not even on whether it was imposed at all. We discussed the possibility of using the data regarding Mask Use by County which provides the probability distribution of how likely people are to wear masks. We thought we could try and model this as the “at risk” population where the proportion of the population that is less likely to wear masks according to this data would be considered at risk. However, it only seemed to be scaling the data by a constant and the graph trends looked exactly the same so we didn't think there was much use in that. This is because we tried using the same probability distribution for all days. People usually change their opinions a lot, especially those with answers in gray areas like RARELY, SOMETIMES or FREQUENTLY. This led us to believe the at risk population distribution will also change day to day. So it would be interesting to be able to model that if we had more data rather than a fixed distribution that was found in a very small window of time compared to our time series data which spans more than a year.  

Overall the collaboration really helped question our approaches to these kinds of analyses to make sure we cover all angles and perspectives. I had a discussion with Nicole Riggio regarding how it’s very easy to use this little data we have and represent the visualizations in a misleading way as to show in an exaggerated expressive visualization as to exactly how mask mandates have directly influenced the reduced rates of infection. We have to be careful and know where to draw the line in such cases. The lesson being we might not always find what we want with the data but we should definitely not obtain results by any means necessary.
