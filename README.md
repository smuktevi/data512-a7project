# Human-Centered Data Science Project
DATA 512 Final Project: A4-7

## Project Introduction
 
After the mask mandates were set in place there were many instances where people refused to follow policies. This non-cooperation wasn’t only regarding the masking policies but other policies as well such as getting vaccinated or social distancing. This was due to different reasons like some political inclination where some leaders didn’t support masking, people feeling uncomfortable with masking, or just outrageous conspiracy theories. Therefore, although we had mask mandates set in place there were still people that failed to follow through. 
   
From the assessment in A4[1], we know when mask mandates were introduced in Harris County, TX, and we also observed the trends in covid infection rates across April 2020 to October 2021. For this project I wanted to look into more qualitative data to understand how different kinds of people were influenced by various policies and how the level of their concern for the pandemic changed accordingly. Therefore, I took a look into Survey Data[2] from the state of Texas. From this survey I had data regarding employment status, education levels, demographics, measure of intent to follow certain basic policies, rating of coronavirus concern and even belief levels in myths and rumors about covid. All this information could be related to or even directly affect the way people understand the pandemic and mitigation policies. We learned in class about Thick Data[3] and how when we look at data regarding people there's a more human centered aspect to be considered than just looking at data points. My aim here was to take a more human centered approach to my analysis by looking at the story behind why some people were more concerned with the coronavirus versus others who seemed to be indifferent to it. I thought this Survey Data would be perfect to achieve my objective due to it’s qualitative information on people during the pandemic.  
   
The biggest policy that is believed to have had the most effect on curbing covid transmissions seemed to be the strict lockdown imposition and travel restrictions. These were some of the more extreme measures taken to reduce transmissions rates. Mobility struck me as an interesting metric to measure against covid transmission to see how different kinds of mobility within the county affected transmission rates. This is why I included Mobility Data[4] into my analysis.  
   
My motivation for this is due to the discomfort I faced when some people just couldn’t follow the right covid protocols to keep themselves and others safe. From another perspective, I wanted to see what factors influenced people directly or indirectly to maintain covid protocols. I thought I could study this in-depth to see if there was a more concrete data-driven answer to this question.  
   
This study can be useful in multiple ways bringing clarity to the behavior of people during the pandemic. We can try to find what factors influence or relate to covid concerns and try to find ways to mitigate the risk of infection due to those factors. We can look at how more extreme policies, like restricted travel, actually affect transmission rates and create awareness to ensure more people follow such policies when advised in the future.  
  

## Research Questions

### Question 1 
 
Is the Coronavirus Concern of a person influenced by their;
* Education levels,
* Employment status,
* Measure of intent to follow basic covid policies.
 
*Hypothesis: Coronavirus concern relates to Education Levels, Employment Status or Measure of Intent to following covid policies.*

### Question 2

Do COVID cases per day show any meaningful relation with the various kinds of mobility data?

*Hypothesis: COVID transmission changes with different kinds of Mobility in different ways.*
